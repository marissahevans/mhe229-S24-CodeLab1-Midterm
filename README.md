# Midterm Project 

3D starting version of future psychophyical experiment. 

Objective is to move mouse toward targets without visual cursor feedback, then click on the target to enter your endpoint. 
You can then change the size of a sphere centered on the target location to attemp to enclose your endpoint. 
Feedback is shown after your sphere size is entered. Points are awarded if the endpoint falls inside the sphere, and more points are awarded for smaller spheres. 

Things that need to be figured out:
How to make the cursor disapear 
how to make the cursor start at the same location each trial 
Order of opperations within a trial (should they be levels or scenes?)
How to record the click location in the screen coordinates
How to change the size of the sphere with key inputs (arrow keys?) 
Display points possible
